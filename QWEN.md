## INHERITED FROM constitution/QWEN.md

**The inheritance below is conditional. Both cases are stated; neither is
assumed.**

When this module is consumed inside a project that includes the Helix
Constitution submodule, the rules in `constitution/QWEN.md` — and in the
`constitution/Constitution.md` it references — are authoritative for every
topic not covered here. The module-local rules below extend them; they never
weaken or override them.

When this module is consumed standalone — cloned on its own, with no
constitution reachable in any parent — there is nothing to inherit, and **only
the module-local rules below apply**.

### Locating the base file: a resolver, never a path

`constitution/QWEN.md` in the heading above is the **canonical name of the base
file**, written exactly as the constitution's own examples write it. It is not
a filesystem path relative to this module, and it must not be rewritten into
one:

- a consuming project may mount the constitution under more than one layout,
  and this module cannot know which one it got;
- the same commit of this module can be checked out at two different depths at
  the same time, so no single relative path is correct for both;
- a standalone clone has no constitution anywhere, so any hardcoded path would
  simply dangle.

Resolve it at run time with the constitution's own parent-walk resolver,
**`find_constitution.sh`**. It walks up the parent chain trying each layout the
constitution supports, follows
`git rev-parse --show-superproject-working-tree` out of nested submodules so it
works from any nested depth, and exits non-zero with an explicit error when no
constitution is reachable — which is precisely the standalone case above.

This file therefore hardcodes **no** parent-project path and **no**
depth-dependent path, keeping the module project-not-aware, decoupled and
reusable per §11.4.28(B). Agent tooling with a native file-import syntax must
not turn the heading into one: an `@constitution/QWEN.md` import resolves
relative to *this* file, so inside a module it points at a path that does not
exist and silently resolves to nothing.

The project-local notes below extend the inherited base rules; they never
weaken or override them.
# Vasic-Digital GitHub Pages Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains automation scripts for managing the vasic-digital.github.io website. It appears to be a GitHub Pages site with custom automation for commit operations and upstream repository management.

Key components:
- Custom `commit` script for automated Git commits with configurable messages
- Upstream configuration for the GitHub repository
- Environment configuration support via `env.properties`

## Repository Structure
```
Vasic-Digital/
├── commit                    # Custom commit script with environment support
├── README.md               # Project documentation (currently empty)
├── QWEN.md                 # Current file with project context
└── Upstreams/
    └── GitHub.sh           # Defines the upstream repository URL
```

## Key Files and Functionality

### commit script
- A bash script that automates Git commit operations
- Reads configuration from `env.properties` file if available
- Supports default commit messages via `DEFAULT_COMMIT_MESSAGE` environment variable
- Supports project names via `PROJECT_NAME` environment variable
- Usage: `./commit "optional commit message"` or `./commit` for default message

### Upstreams/GitHub.sh
- Exports the upstream repository URL: `git@github.com:vasic-digital/vasic-digital.github.io.git`
- This indicates the project is a GitHub Pages site (based on the `.github.io.git` suffix)

### Environment Configuration
The commit script supports an `env.properties` file in the root directory with variables:
- `DEFAULT_COMMIT_MESSAGE`: Sets the default commit message when no argument is provided
- `PROJECT_NAME`: Prefixes commit messages with the project name

## Development Workflow
This project appears to provide automation for regularly updating the GitHub Pages site with automated commits. The workflow likely involves:
1. Making changes to the repository
2. Using the custom `commit` script to push changes to GitHub
3. Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages via the vasic-digital.github.io repository

## Building and Running
This is primarily a configuration/automation repository. There are no build steps required for the scripts themselves, but they are meant to be executed to automate Git operations.

To use the commit script:
1. Make sure your changes are staged in Git
2. Execute `./commit` or `./commit "Your commit message"`
3. The script will commit and push changes to the upstream repository

## Usage Notes
- The repository is managed by these custom scripts and is meant to sync with the GitHub Pages repository
- SSH keys should be configured for access to the upstream GitHub repository
- The `env.properties` file is optional but can customize commit behavior
