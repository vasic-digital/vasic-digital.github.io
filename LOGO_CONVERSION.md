# Logo Conversion Instructions

## Creating Transparent Logo

For proper integration with the website, the logo needs to be converted to have a transparent background. Here are the steps to create the transparent version:

1. Take the original "Assets/Logo.jpeg" file
2. Use an image editing tool to remove the white background
3. Save the result as "Assets/Logo-transparent.png"

## Tools you can use:
- Adobe Photoshop
- GIMP (free alternative)
- Online tools like remove.bg, Canva, or Photopea

## Once converted, update the HTML files to use the transparent version:
- index.html: Update the src attribute from "Assets/Logo.jpeg" to "Assets/Logo-transparent.png" for both header and footer logos
